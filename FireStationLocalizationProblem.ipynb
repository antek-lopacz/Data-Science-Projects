    "\n",
    "This class employs the Simulated Annealing (SA) metaheuristic to find an approximate solution for the Minimum Dominating Set (MDS) problem. SA navigates the solution space by iteratively transitioning between solutions, always accepting improvements and probabilistically accepting worsening moves based on a cooling \"temperature,\" which helps avoid premature convergence to local optima.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Initialization Parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "The `SimulatedAnnealingMDS` class is configured using the following parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **`adjacency_matrix` (np.ndarray):**\n",
    "    A square matrix defining the graph structure, where an entry indicates an edge between two vertices.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **`initial_temp` (float):**\n",
    "    The starting temperature for the annealing process. A higher value encourages broader exploration initially by increasing the likelihood of accepting worse solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **`final_temp` (float):**\n",
    "    The termination temperature. The algorithm stops when the system temperature cools down to this near-zero value.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **`alpha` (float):**\n",
    "    The cooling rate, a factor (between 0 and 1) by which the temperature is multiplicatively reduced at each step of the cooling schedule. Values closer to 1 lead to slower cooling.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **`iterations` (int):**\n",
    "    Defines the number of candidate solutions evaluated per \"temperature stage\" or acts as an overall iteration cap depending on the cooling schedule's interaction with `final_temp`.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **`penalty` (float, optional):**\n",
    "    A value added to a solution's cost for each vertex not covered by the candidate dominating set, thereby penalizing invalid solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **`seed` (int | None, optional):**\n",
    "    An optional seed for the internal random number generator to ensure reproducible experimental results. If `None`, behavior will be non-deterministic."
